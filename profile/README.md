# Haiko

Haiko is an Intent-based Automated Market Making (AMM) protocol for building _expressive_ LP strategies that run on autopilot. It features programmable positions, on-chain limit orders, custom market schemas, and other powerful LP features.

Haiko is powered by Starknet, an Ethereum-based Layer 2 (L2) network that enables fast, cheap and provable on-chain execution of complex strategies.

You can learn more about Haiko's intent-based architecture by reading our [docs](https://docs.haiko.xyz/), or access our public interface at [app.haiko.xyz](https://app.haiko.xyz/).
